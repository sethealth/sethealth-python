# Sethealth py-client

Sethealth python client allows to access the backend sethealth API from a server. The unique use case of this library today is to provide a authentication schema to delegate the "frontend" javascript library to communicate safely with the sethealth backend.

This is accomplish by the generation of a service account in sethealth. A service account is a long-living account for non-human users, like servers. Once a service account is created, a api key and a api secret are generated, this credentials **MUST be kept private, never exposed in a client side application**.

This "long-living" credentials can be used instead to create short-living credentials in the shape of access tokens in order to call the upload/download medical data from the client.

## Install

```
pip install --upgrade sethealth
```
If you have permission problems try adding "--user" option to pip.

## Usage

Get your service account credentials from the [Sethealth Dashboard](https://dashboard.set.health).

**.bashrc/.zshrc:***

```bash
export SETHEALTH_KEY="sa_0000000000000"
export SETHEALTH_SECRET="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx="
```

**__init__.py:***

```python
import sethealth

# Create sethealth client
client = sethealth.Client()

# Ask for a short-living access token
token = client.getToken()
print("ACCESS TOKEN: " + token)
```

Alternatively, the credentials can be provided programatically by passing the `api key` and the `api secret` as arguments to `Client`.

```python
import sethealth

# Credentials
apiKey = 'HERE THE API KEY'
apiSecret = 'HERE THE API SECRET'
client = sethealth.Client(apiKey, apiSecret)

# Ask for a short-living access token
token = client.getToken()
print("ACCESS TOKEN: " + token)
```

>Note: Credentials should be kept secret, it's not a good practice to hard code them in the source code.
